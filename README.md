# Crowdfunding_ETL
This repository consists of the assignment for the ETL mimi project. An ETL pipeline is built using Python, Pandas and Python dictionary method to extract and transform the data. After the transformation of data, the data were stored in csv files which was later used to create ERD and table schema. Finally, the csv files were uploaded into the Postgres database.
